# Student Record Management System

## Description

A Java-based console application to manage student records using basic CRUD operations.

## What I Did

- Created a `Student` class with ID, name, and marks.
- Used `ArrayList` to store student data.
- Implemented options to add, view, update, and delete students.
- Built a menu-driven interface with `Scanner` for input handling.

## How It Works

1. Displays a menu with options: Add, View, Update, Delete, Exit.
2. Takes user input to perform the selected operation.
3. Stores and updates student data in memory (using `ArrayList`).
4. Runs continuously until the user chooses to exit.
